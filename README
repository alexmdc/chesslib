ChessLib is a C library for working with chess games and positions.

The initial goal is to support loading and saving of complete libraries of
games in PGN format, including comments, sub-variations, and custom PGN tags.

Hopefully it could be used as the back-end of of some PGN processing software
or even a GUI-based chess client :)

This code currently lives at github:
